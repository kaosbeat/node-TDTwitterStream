TDTwitterStream
-----------------

ntwitter does a pretty good job at getting the stream to our machines, but that's where it gives up and leaves us to it. TDTwitterStream is a SiteStreams helper that takes the ntwitter output and wraps it in some logic that emits events when certain conditions happen.

Currently, it only supports SiteStreams but I'm sure it could be made to support userstreams with minimal work.
